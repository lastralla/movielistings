# Demo App

Need to have some things installed globally:

- webpack
- webpack-dev-server
- and likely a few others being forgotten at moment


Setup project

```
> npm install
```

## Add API TOKEN

Search code `<KEYHERE>` and replace string with token. (This should ideally be in a config file.)


To build project

```
> webpack
```

To start dev server

```
> npm start
```

go to `http://localhost:8080/`
